# About Classical Computer Science

There are currently two approaches to teaching computer science in the
K-12 setting. The first and most common is to not teach it at all. The
second is to teach it as a purely technical skill -- certain
programming languages are presented as the main 'engine' of
computation. Curricula berate students with "modern" programming
buzzwords backed by commercial interests. Students come away believing
memorizing keywords or API documentation is the crux of computer
science. Both of these approaches fail to capture the wonder that
computation ought to inspire. Worse yet, many leave students with an
erroneous belief that computation is a topic only for 'technical'
people with a knack for memorization.

Whatever one's view on technology, it cannot be denied that automated
computation has fundamentally altered human development and is today
an integral part of human history. Therefore, both of these approaches
are wrong. The first is wrong because it eschews study of computation
altogether. The second is wrong because it presents too limited a view
of computation. Computer science _is not_ the same as learning Python,
Java, Object-oriented programming, software development, or any of the
thousands of other buzzwords that have become prevalent in the
computer science industry. Rather, it is the study of two of the most
fundamental forces in human nature: information and
decision-making. Thus, it too deserves proper mention and study in a complete
education.

Classical education has recently re-captured the interests of many
parents and educators who are seeking to provide children with an
education that does more than simply teach facts. This model, taking
its inspiration from the Greco-Roman tradition of a liberal education
seeks to foster a holistic approach that integrates knowledge across
disciplines. The goal is to create a well-rounded individual wholly
oriented towards the pursuit of the true, good, and beautiful. The
humanities are well represented in most classical curricula, as are
the classical sciences -- biology, physics, chemistry. Arithmetic also
finds its place among the fields of study.

At its most foundational level, computation is the study of automated
logic. Computers are one of the best tools to study the foundations of
logic in a systematized rigorous way. Moreover, electronic computers
-- for the first time in human history -- allow us to *create* with
logic in ways of which the ancient philosophers could have only
dreamed.

This website and accompanying book are an attempt to build a computer
science curriculum that presents computation not as a technical
phenomenon constrained in silicon wafers and plastic chips, but rather
a fundamental part of our world. Computing is approached from various
perspectives and links are drawn between fields. Aimed primarily at
students in the logic and rhetoric stage, the goal of the curricula is
not to build programmers who have memorized every obscure feature of a
single programming language or framework, but rather who are able to
use computational thinking to reason about the world and their place
in it.
