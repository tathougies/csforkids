The ancient Greek polymath Eratosthenes regularly traveled between the Egyptian cities of Syene and
Alexandria (see \prettyref{fig:alexandria}). He was a very observant scientist, and -- like many
ancient polymaths -- was interested in astronomy. He noticed that, on the summer solstice, the
following things were true (see \prettyref{fig:eratosthenes}):
\begin{marginfigure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\marginparwidth]{../week3/figures/syene-alexandria.jpg}

  \caption{The distance between the Egyptian cities of Alexandria and Syene is 5000 stadia or approximately 787.5 kilometers apart.}
  \label{fig:alexandria}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In Syene, which was south of Alexandria, on the summer solstice, the sun shone straight down. If he looked at the bottom of a deep well, there were no shadows at all. If you planted a stick in the ground, the stick would cast no shadow, because the sun was directly overhead.
\item In Alexandria, to the north, on the same day at the same time, if you planted a stick in the ground, there was a shadow.
\end{enumerate}

What can be deduced based off these two observations?

Here's some more details: the straight-line distance between the two cities is approximately 787.5
kilometers apart. Also, the angle of the shadow cast on the ground in Alexandria was $7.5^{\circ}$.

Eratosthenes did the following calculation:

\[
\underbrace{787.5\;\text{kilometers}}_{\text{distance between the two cities}} \times \frac{360^{\circ}}{7.5^{\circ}} \approx 40,000\;\text{kilometers}
\]

\didyouknow{
Albert Einstein famously came up with his theory of special relativity by simply thinking about it!
If you ever study physics in depth, you'll discover that the entirety of special relativity falls
out of two simple facts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The speed of light is the same for everyone.
\item The relationship between the sides of the triangle: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.
\end{enumerate}
Einstein used these simple facts to show that light actually travels less distance in moving
reference frames, leading to one of the most surprising facts about our universe: fast things become
shorter.  }
\begin{BigIdeaBox}
As humans, we only see our part of the world and our part of the universe. The consistent
application of precise rules lets us reason about things larger than what we can directly perceive.

Despite having no possible way to observe the entirety of the planet. Eratosthenes used simple rules
of logic and simple observations to deduce a global truth.

\section{Numbers All the Way Down}

Last week, we discussed how computers store numbers using switches that are either on or
off. \hint{See \prettyref{sec:binary-numbers} for a review.}

Everything on a computer is stored as numbers. Even the words we saw last class are stored using
numbers. Every letter in a word (or a \term{string} as Python calls it) is assigned a number. We
call these numbers the \term{encoding} of the string.\hint{Python will sometimes abbreviate \term{string} as \code{str}.}

Most modern computers today use the \term{Unicode} standard for encoding strings. Unicode is a
\emph{huge} dictionary mapping every character possibly known to humans to a number assigned by an
international committee.\didyouknow{As of the latest Unicode standard, there are over 297,334
  characters! That's a lot of letters!} Before Unicode standardized the mapping of characters,
computer systems would often use their own custom standard or a standard particular to individual
countries and languages. Reading files created using one standard on a computer designed to work
with another standard could result in garbage data. Another common way to write strings as numbers
is called \term{ASCII}, which stands for the \emph{American Standard Code for Information
Interchange}. ASCII covers most characters used in English and other languages that use the Latin
alphabet. It's also compatible with Unicode -- Unicode maps every Latin letter to the same ASCII
character.

It may seem crazy that each letter has a number that goes along with it, but I can prove it to you. Try this in Python:

\hint{If you want to see a new kind of error called a \code{ValueError}, try\\
\code{ord('hello')}!}
\begin{replbox}
>>> ord('5')<ENTER>
53
>>> ord('Z')<ENTER>
90
>>> ord('>')<ENTER>
62
>>> ord('\'')<ENTER>(*@ \tikzmarknode{python escapes node}{} @*)
39
>>> ord('h')<ENTER>
104
\end{replbox}
\makemargmark{python escapes node}{\notestyle\hintnote Python words are delimited by single quotation marks (\code{'}). But what if you want to talk about the word consisting of just the single quote character itself or a word containing a single quote character (like an Irish name with \enquote{O'})? In order to tell Python that you want a \code{'} treated as just the letter and not part of the Python rules, you use the \code{\textbackslash} character in front of it. This word \code{'\textbackslash''} is just the word consisting of a single single-quote letter.}

You can also go from a number \emph{to} a word.

\hint{Try all kinds of numbers here, and see what you get!}
\begin{replbox}
>>> chr(76)<ENTER>
'L'
>>> chr(53)<ENTER>
'5'
>>> chr(54)<ENTER>
'6'
>>> chr(233)<ENTER>
'é'
>>> chr(1103)<ENTER>
'я'
>>> chr(26159)<ENTER>
'是'
>>> chr(22398)<ENTER>
'学'(*@\tikzmarknode{chinese xie}{}@*)
>>> chr(128512)<ENTER>
'(*@{\EmojiFont 😀}@*)'
\end{replbox}
\makemargmark{chinese xie}{\hintnote \enquote{学}(\emph{xi\`e}) means to learn in Mandarin. That's what we're doing right now, and you just learned something new!}

Lest we forget that it's still all just ones and zeros, you can use the \code{bin} rule that we
learned about last week to see the binary representation of these numbers.

\begin{replbox}
>>> bin(ord('5'))<ENTER>
'0b100111'(*@\tikzmarknode{single quotes around binary numbers}{}@*)
>>> bin(ord('Z'))<ENTER>
'0b1011010'
>>> bin(ord('\''))<ENTER>
'0b100111'
\end{replbox}
\makemargmark{single quotes around binary numbers}{\notestyle\huhnote{I thought the single quotes meant words. Why do we keep seeing them when we ask for binary numbers?}\\
Because Python is friendly, it always shows numbers as decimal, even though they are stored as binary on the computer. The \code{bin} rule actually creates a word, or string, that represents the binary representation. This lets you see it here.}

See it's just numbers all the way down!

  All information inside a modern computer is stored as numbers, even words!
