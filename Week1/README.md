# Lesson 1: Deterministic Processes

## Big Idea

Some systems behave in a completely predictable way: if you start them the same way they *must* end the same way. Computers are built on this idea.

This week establishes a foundational mental model for the whole course: _A computer is am achine that follows rules perfectly, without guessing or improvising_.

## Motivating Demo

### Balloon

Need two balloons. One is full and tied. Throw it up and down.

*The balloon always comes down*

Fill the other balloon up; let it go. Where the balloon lands up seems random.

*Would we be able to figure out where it lands if we knew exactly all the information about it?*

Introduce Turing tumble game. Show a simple machine. Is the output always the same?

Show Turing Tumble caluclator?


## Discuss

What is deterministic? What does it mean for things to always behave the same way? Computers are just things that behave the same way.

### Points to hit:

* A deterministic process always produces the same output from the same input.
* Predictability depends on knowing the rules and the starting conditions
* Being complex does not make something not deterministic. If we knew the details, we can still predict what happens.


## Exercise

Introduce binary numbers. Give exercises for Turing Tumble.

## Final Demo

Introduce Python IDLE environment. Show simple expressions
